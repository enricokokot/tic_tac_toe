# Tic-tac-toe AI

Class project for the Software agents course at the Pula Faculty of Engineering.

The project implements a game of Tic-tac-toe with selectable AI opponents of which each uses one of two approaches: the minmax algorithm and 
reinforcement learning, more specifically, Q-learning. The Q-learning algorithm is only implemented here while 
it's training is part of [my colleague's repository](https://github.com/Xenay/Reinforcement-learning-tic-tac-toe).

## Usage

1. Run the **main.py** file.
2. Choose the types of player for both sides (AI 0 uses minmax, AI 1 uses Q-learning).
3. Have fun and sorry for the bugs. :)
